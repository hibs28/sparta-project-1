### Challenges
1. One of the challenges I had was creating a rotating cube with WebGl library and Gl-Matrix. I had to create everything from scratch for example how the cube will show on the screen, the dimensions, materials of the cube and much more. This was up to 260 lines in code for one cube. This would be very time consuming to code therefore I chose a different library, (Three.js) to code with.
2. There wasn't much documentation on Three.js, this made it difficult when researching examples or answers for the problems I had when coding. 
3. Deleting clones of the squares as the clones where children of the original square. When I tried to delete the square it will delete not only the clones but the original square itself. 
4. Moving the square on the `z-axis` which makes the cubes move towards the camera.


### Learning points
1. I learnt how to code using the WebGl library and Three.js library. 
2. Creating clones of the squares. 
3. How to create 3D objects in three.js.
